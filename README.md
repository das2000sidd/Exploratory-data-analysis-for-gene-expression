# Exploratory-data-analysis-for-metadata-for-subsequent-association-analysis-with_gene-expression

This github repo holds some of the code for the exploratory data analysis I did for looking at association of air pollutants with gene expression (microarray) in the ALSPAC cohort. The cohort represented children with average age of 10. The paper is at: https://academic.oup.com/eep/article/10/1/dvae025/7929971
The association analysis code can be found at: https://github.com/das2000sidd/Code-for-Paper-2-of-thesis
